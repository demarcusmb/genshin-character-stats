# Getting Started
To use this site simply type in the name of a character within the search bar if that character has a space in their name be sure to use - instead of a space.
When you have chosen the character you would like you can use enter or press the button to the right labeled as get character data. If you would like to reset the screen to blank click the reset data button.

# Future Enhancements
I plan to add sometime in the future a list of artifacts that will show to use on each character.
